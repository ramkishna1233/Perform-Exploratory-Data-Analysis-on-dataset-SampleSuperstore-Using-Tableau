 As a business manager, try to find out the weak areas where you can work to make more profit. 
Conclusion: From the above EDA we can conclude that
a) The furniture category is giving very less profit,so the sales  of the furniture should be increased.
b)Some states are giving less profits , so sales in these states should be increased.
c)Subcategories like tables, bookcases,supplies are also giving less profit.
d) Technology department is having lowest sales still it provides highest profits.So increasing sales of the products under technology department,will give our superstore high gains.
